# Pluralsight's Unit Testing in Angular Course

An Angular application that demonstrates various forms of unit testing and automated testing.  I used the Karma test-runner 
and the Jasmine framework.  I built this project along with the "Unit Testing in Angular" tutorial on Pluralsight by Joe Eames.

To run the application: npm start
To run the Karma tests: npm test
To run the automated e2e testing: npm e2e
